Edit Request Wizard
Microtask 1
Steps that I followed:-
1.	Visited an article page on Wikipedia .
2.	Clicked on edit source button next to a paragraph.
3.	A page opened as shown below:

4.	I clicked on ‘Help: I have been blocked’.
5.	Then clicked on Wikipedia: Request an account.
6.	Followed the next procedures.
7.	Got a email from Wikipedia that my account was created with username and password provided. I was asked to change my password after which my account got activated.
8.	I finally logged in.
9.	Opened the same article on Wikipedia and clicked on edit source.
10.	I got this page:

11.	I successfully edited the page by adding a reference to the article.Look below the reference circled in red was added by me.
12.	![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97789856/161393860-531a0eab-6fd2-4c0b-9828-113a6dd8d1bb.png)
If I would redesign the process , the changes that I would suggest are as follows:
•	The UI of the web form should be more attractive.
•	A more simpler pathway for a beginner (unregistered editer) can be introduced.
•	Source Input should have auto-reliability check.
•	Quote area must be introduced(I know this is already a part of microtask 3).

I designed this form using Figma:

Till now I have designed a very basic form using frontend technology.
I am working on designing its UI and also on the backend of the web form.Very soon I will provide a updated link of it’s github repo and also the url to my finished full stack web form.
But as of now I have done till this much (my work is under progress)
